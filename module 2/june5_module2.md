# Module 2 Fail-Log

### Exercise 1: 

* I researched "Samba" (my last name) in the [Commonwealth War Graves Commission, Find War Dead database] [1]
* I found 22 records: https://www.cwgc.org/find/find-war-dead/results?lastName=Samba
* A note (for whoever might eventually read this): Samba is an extremely common name across numerous African countries, most results show people from Gambia, Sierra Leone, the "Gold Coast," etc., which are far more likely to be actual countries of origin than the DRC.

### Exercise 2:

* Succesfully saved [http://activehistory.ca/papers/] thanks to Ian Milligan's wget excercise, which can be found [here][2].
* Created a new directory where all of the papers are currently saved (/war-diary)
* I've succesfully managed to save all of the pictures from the 14th Canadian General Hospital war diaries
	* This, of course, was done in an "acceptable and respectful manner".

### Exercise 3:

STILL NEED TO DO

### Exercise 4:

Note: This exercise was quite interesting. In all honesty, I used to think the information at the end of a link indicated the specific location of a file on a website, rather than it being an API command that asked the host server/computer to pull-up information in a particular way.
The [API support page][3] was extremely interesting to dive into!

* In this exercise, I pulled data from 1800-1802 from the Canadian Discovery Portal, using the &fmt=json search query (API) at the end of the link. 
* Then created a program to pull all the oochim numbers, which would allow me to save the individual files.

### Exercise 5:

* I tried downloading an older version of Twarc with no success.
* I got the following error message:
	* "sudo: pip: command not found"
* I will look into this further as Twitter truly is a data field I am interested in, both for this class as well as for future research.

### Exercise 6:

* Succesfully converted an image into text!
